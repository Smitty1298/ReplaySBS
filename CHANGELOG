* Fix `MapUser` inheritence (now properly inherits from `ReplayContainer`)
* Fix incorrect `__add__` method for `Check`
* Rename `Keys` to `Key` (`Keys` left available as deprecated)
* Don't double load `ReplayInfo` when using `Map`
* Rename `Detect` attributes to reflect the `Detect` class (eg, `max_angle` -> `correction_max_angle`). This avoids confusion of attributes when multiple `Detect`s are combined. Previous names left available as deprecated.
